# Main Features For This Project
•	The code is implemented purely in “C++” language.
•	It is divided into classes with clear comments on each class allowing the reader to track the objects/classes relations.
•	In the beginning the user will need to create an admin account using username & password, in order to edit, add new items or interact with the system.
•	After creating a new account, the admin will have the privileges to:
  o	Add & Register items that the restaurant offers.
  o	Edit the menu to contain the items he wishes.
  o	Check the total bill of certain table or order.
  o	Make payments using credit cards or cash.
  o	Check for available tables.
  o	Check for other users account information
  o	Print the order & order status showing whether the order is ready to be served or still getting cooked.
•	The software also comes with a simple GUI written in Qt C++ to allow the user to communicate with it with ease.
•	The project CRC diagram, EER diagram, Class diagram, Sequence diagram , Use case diagram , State diagram & Semantic Data model are available through the following link :
